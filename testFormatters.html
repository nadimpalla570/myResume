    <h1>Data Science</h1>

    <p><i>from wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</i></p>
    <p>Not to be confused with Information science or Computer science.</p>
    <p><b><mark>Data science</mark></b>> is an interdisciplinary academic field<sup>[1]</sup>
        <br/> uses statistics, <mark><u><b>computing, scientific</b></u></mark> methods, processing, scientific visualization, algorithms and systems to extract or extrapolate knowledge from potentially noisy, structured, or unstructured data.[2]
         <br/> Data science also integrates domain knowledge from the underlying application domain (e.g., natural sciences, information technology, and medicine).[3]  <br/> Data science is multifaceted and can be described as a science, a research paradigm, a research method, a discipline, a workflow, and a profession.[4]</p>
    <p><del>science</del> is "a concept to unify statistics, data analysis, informatics, and their related methods" to "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data.[5] 
        <br/>It uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, information science, and domain knowledge.[6] <br/>
        However, data science is different from computer science and information science. Turing Award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a "fourth paradigm" of science (empirical, theoretical, computational, and now data-driven) and asserted that "everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology" and the data deluge.
        <br/><sup>[7][8]</sup>Data science is often described as a multidisciplinary field because it draws on techniques from diverse areas, such as computer science, statistics, information science, and other subject-specific disciplines. Some researchers say that the combination of the different fields is similar to how information science was decades ago (Mayernik, 2023). These similarities help us understand how data science became its own field of study. [9]
        <br/>A data scientist is a professional who creates programming code and combines it with statistical knowledge to summarize data.[10] </p>
